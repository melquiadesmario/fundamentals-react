# Fundamentals React JS

This project aims to practice the fundamental concepts of React JS.

Next we go step by step through some basic and fundamental concepts in ReactJS. I will not go into the technology concepts behind ReactJS as a Webpack.

## First Step

In your project directory, through the command line we will start a project using the project created by the Facebook development team to speed up the initial configuration of a web-based project using the following command:

`npx create-react-app my-app`

The only dependencies that were used were the `VSCode` and` Node.js` code editor. You can also use it if you prefer the `Yarn` package manager.

At the moment I am studying I use version `v12.16.1` of Node.js.

After some time with the creation of the project, we enter the project folder through the command line `cd your-project` and start the application with the command `yarn start`.
